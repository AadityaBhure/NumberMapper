# NumberMapper
Number mapping, also known as proportional mapping or scaling, is a mathematical process used to establish a relationship between two sets of numbers or values. This technique involves selecting a number from one range (range 1) and determining its corresponding value in another range (range 2) based on a proportional relationship between the two sets of numbers.

The process of number mapping can be understood through the following steps:

1. **Define the Two Ranges**: The first step is to define the two ranges of numbers, which represent the domains of the mapping. These ranges could represent any measurable quantities such as time, distance, temperature, or any other numerical values.

2. **Identify Corresponding Pairs**: Once the ranges are defined, identify pairs of corresponding numbers between the two ranges. These pairs establish the mapping relationship and are used to determine the relationship between the values in the two ranges.

3. **Establish Proportional Relationship**: Determine the proportional relationship between the values in range 1 and range 2. This relationship could be linear or nonlinear, depending on the nature of the data and the mapping requirements.

4. **Select a Number from Range 1**: Choose a specific number from range 1 for which you want to find the corresponding value in range 2. This number serves as the input for the mapping process.

5. **Calculate Corresponding Value in Range 2**: Use the proportional relationship established in step 3 to calculate the corresponding value of the selected number from range 1 in range 2. This calculation ensures that the mapped value maintains the same proportionality as the original value.

6. **Repeat for Other Numbers (Optional)**: If necessary, repeat steps 4 and 5 for other numbers in range 1 to map their corresponding values in range 2. This step allows for the mapping of multiple values between the two ranges.

7. **Validate and Interpret Results**: Once the mapping process is complete, validate the results to ensure accuracy and consistency. Interpret the mapped values in range 2 to understand their significance in relation to the original values in range 1.

Number mapping finds applications in various fields such as data analysis, engineering, finance, and statistics. It allows analysts and researchers to establish relationships between different sets of numerical data, facilitating comparisons, predictions, and decision-making processes. Whether it's scaling measurements, converting currencies, or analyzing trends, number mapping provides a valuable tool for understanding the relationships between numerical values across different domains.
